## Project Overview
This project is a backend service designed to fetch and display show data from an external API. The application utilises modern JavaScript features and follows best practices for code organisation, error handling, and testing.

## Key Decisions, Reasoning, and Trade-offs

### 1. **Decision**: Use ES Modules
   - **Reasoning**: Adopting ES modules (`import/export`) allows for better readability and a more modern approach to JavaScript development.
   - **Trade-offs**: Some older packages or tooling may not fully support ES modules. However, this decision aligns with current standards and prepares the codebase for future updates.

### 2. **Decision**: Use the `dotenv` package for environment configuration
   - **Reasoning**: Using `dotenv` enables easy management of environment variables, keeping sensitive information like API URLs out of the codebase.
   - **Trade-offs**: It introduces an external dependency, but this is outweighed by the improved security and maintainability of configuration management.

### 3. **Decision**: Implement data fetching with `node-fetch`
   - **Reasoning**: The `node-fetch` library simplifies HTTP requests in Node.js, making the code cleaner and more concise.
   - **Trade-offs**: This choice might not be as efficient as using native fetch APIs, but it ensures compatibility with Node.js and enhances the readability of asynchronous code.

### 4. **Decision**: Comprehensive error handling in the fetch function
   - **Reasoning**: Including detailed error handling allows for graceful failure and better debugging, providing useful feedback during data fetch failures.
   - **Trade-offs**: More complex code may lead to increased maintenance, but it significantly improves user experience and helps identify issues quickly.

### 5. **Decision**: Use Jest as the testing framework
   - **Reasoning**: Jest is widely adopted and provides robust features for testing asynchronous code, making it suitable for this project.
   - **Trade-offs**: Although Jest is a powerful tool, it may introduce a learning curve for developers unfamiliar with it. However, its benefits in terms of test coverage and reliability justify its inclusion.

### 6. **Decision**: Design the frontend layout using CSS Grid
   - **Reasoning**: CSS Grid allows for responsive designs that can easily adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring a better user experience.
   - **Trade-offs**: The complexity of grid layouts may require additional testing across different browsers, but the benefits in layout flexibility and responsiveness are significant.

## Concessions Due to Time Constraints
### 1. **Concession**: Limited Testing Coverage
   - **Reasoning**: Focused on critical functionalities within the time frame, leading to some edge cases being untested.
   - **Trade-offs**: While essential features are covered, potential bugs in less critical paths may go unnoticed.

### 2. **Concession**: Basic Error Messaging
   - **Reasoning**: The error messages provided are functional but not user-friendly. More elaborate messages could enhance user experience but were deprioritised.
   - **Trade-offs**: This might affect user satisfaction, but the priority was to deliver a working solution promptly.

## Future Improvements
- **Enhance Testing**: Expand the test suite to cover more edge cases and functionalities.
- **Development**: "Implement concurrency to handle tasks in parallel."
- **Documentation**: Add inline comments and documentation for easier onboarding of new developers.
- **Features**: Add a modal for the 'About the show' section of the UI application.
- **UI**: Inspect the example image design to insure my application matches the design exact.
